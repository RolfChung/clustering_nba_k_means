# clustering_nba_k_means

In this clustering project a set of NBA players is grouped in such a way that NBA players in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).

This done by implementing the K-Means algorithm in step by step code and also using as an comparable sklearn, after exploring and cleaning the data.

The data is based on player performance from the 2013-2014 season collected by <a href="https://www.rotowire.com/"> rotwire</a> .
